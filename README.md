## 2D Maze Solver

The 2D Maze Solver is a Python-based project that combines maze generation and pathfinding to create and solve mazes within a two-dimensional grid. It utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) for maze creation and the A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding. This project provides an interactive experience using Pygame and OpenGL.
